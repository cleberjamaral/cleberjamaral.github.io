# moments

I have a [linkedin](https://br.linkedin.com/in/cleber-jorge-amaral-77827a10) account in which I rarely post something, but I try to keep the profile updated. I also have a [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/cleberjamaral) account where I don't post very often and usually I remove my old posts \(which is probably ineffective against [Cambridge Analytica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica), [Clearview](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/10/tech/clearview-ai-ceo-hoan-ton-that/index.html) and similar\). I use [google photos](https://photos.google.com/) to store my private digital albums.

## Recent activities

* 07/2020: I have participate on [AI for Industry 4.0 Summer School](https://ai4industry.sciencesconf.org/) promoted by [Ã‰cole des Mines de Saint-Etienne](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/) which also had a [hackathon](ai4industry-hackathon.md) in which the participants put their hands on a development of a system based in Multi-Agents to control the process of a hypothetical factory of yoghurt from filling yoghurt containers to packaging them.
* 07/2020: Two studies were presented on [WESAAC 2020](http://dainf.pg.utfpr.edu.br/wesaac2020/accepted_papers.html): "[Agent Programming for Industrial Applications: Some Advantages and Drawbacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05613)" and "[Towards Jacamo-rest: Multi-Agent Systems from the Perspective of Resource-Oriented Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05619)".
* 06/2020: I have presented [2020' Multi-Agent Programming Contest](https://www.slideshare.net/clebercbr/ai-for-multiagent-programming-contest-2020) at NZDIS Research Group to discuss possible Artificial Intelligence techniques that can be applied in the competition.
* 05/2020: I have presented the demo paper of "A Framework for Collaborative and Interactive Agent-oriented Developer Operations" in [AAMAS 2020](https://aamas2020.conference.auckland.ac.nz/) which is based on "Agent DevOps", a study that proposes an architecture and software life cycle for designing and managing agents in a DevOps-like manner \([video](https://underline.io/lecture/124-a-framework-for-collaborative-and-interactive-agent-oriented-developer-operations) / [paper](http://ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2020/pdfs/p2092.pdf)\)
* 05/2020: After going to level 2 and getting back to the office in the University of Otago I have presented by zoom a talk mainly about the importance of [Multi-Agent Oriented Programming paradigm](https://www.slideshare.net/clebercbr/csis-meetingjacamoweb-for-collaborative-and-interactive-programming) using Jacamo-web collaborative and interactive facilities as example.
* 05/2020: I have made [this covid-19 analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cleberjamaral/cleberjamaral.github.io/blob/master/knowledge/research/machine-learning/brazil-states-trajectories-and-deaths.ipynb) about trajectory of cases and deaths in Brazilian states
* 04/2020: A speech on NZDIS about [Collaborative and Interactive programming for Multi-Agent Systems](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1425986) \([PDF](https://people.cs.umu.se/tkampik/Collaborative_and_Interactive_Agent_oriented_Developer_Operations.pdf)\)
* 02/2020: I have talked about my experience on [catching-up web technologies](https://www.slideshare.net/clebercbr/catchingup-web-technologies-an-endless-story).
* 12/2019: I have presented my latest thoughts and my open issues about Organization Design.
