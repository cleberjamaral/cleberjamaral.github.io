# agenda and tasks

I used to be very interested in time management tools and all sort of frameworks to help to improve productivity. I have already tried several approaches. Usually, the approach fits only for a few months. Most of the people that I know had this same experience. It happened to me a lot, mainly because:

* Routines are often boring
* Too much data were stored which is difficult to control
* Postponing many times the same issue is anguishing
* A new tool is attractive

So, changing the framework is often exciting because it is a way to change the routine with a new tool, to move less and really important things, and get rid of many unreal and not essential anguishing thinks.

Currently, I am probably in my record in time using the same approach. I have opted to use what I think is a lightweight method in terms of administration costs. What I mainly do:

* Appointments are registered in a digital calendar \(I use Google Calendar\)
  * It is the only thing I have enabled notifications
* I manage tasks in a kanban like system
  * I have four columns: to do \(I did not set priority yet\), medium priority, high priority and in progress
  * There is no "done" column
  * I try my best to keep few tasks in these columns \(not more than 20 in total\)
* When I am out and want to remember myself about something I write an [email](mails-and-emails.md) to myself
* I have in [my gitbook](../plans/) a list of things that I would like to do, but I don't feel committed with that  
* I try my best to:
  * Do not register non-essential tasks
  * Say "no"
