# mails and emails

Such as my mailbox, my email inbox is always ideally empty \(I use Gmail which centralises my accounts\).

* After reading, I do delete circumstantial things which helps to easier find important things.
* Everything useful is archived without any label, the search tool already does a good job.
* Some email become [tasks](agenda-and-tasks.md) and then are archived.
* I keep an eye on the draft area since some reminder might be there.

About mails, I do store important paper for 5 years, everything else goes to the trash. I have some folders that store paper for the whole family altogether:

* Assets: containing bills related with long-life products, taxes related to assets, and documents related to assets.
* Financial: it contains documents that I have to present in my taxes report and some paid bills that I could be asked for.
* Health: containing exams, medical recipes, etc.
* Important documents: it contains contracts, regiments, important informs, etc.
* Diplomas and certificates
