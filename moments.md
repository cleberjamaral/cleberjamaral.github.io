# moments

I have a [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) account where I don't use to post very often and I use to remove my old posts\*.

I use [google photos](https://photos.google.com/) to store my digital albums.

\*It is probably ineffective since [Cambridge Analytica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica) and [Clearview](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/10/tech/clearview-ai-ceo-hoan-ton-that/index.html) and similars should already have downloaded all the data they needed. To say the truth this memory book is another source to them.
