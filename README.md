# Cleber's mind

## What is on

This is an ongoing book. Currently, I am using that as my notebook. I am often a hoarder and the best way to prevent productivity loss and avoid burnout is to put everything that is in my mind "on the paper" so I can decide what is garbage to put it in the trash bin.

It is something out of my [circle of influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People) of, but I admit I am reactive to coronavirus numbers following [worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).

## About this book

Like everyone I often forget things and often I remember things that I prefer to forget. This repository contains what I would like to keep in memory. In this sense, it is an idealisation where I can keep [useful information](knowledge/), nice [moments](moments.md) and write down the reasoning rules I would like to follow.

It is pretty much inspired in [Nikita's knowledge book](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge) which was the first I found that is doing something that I was looking for.

I plan to write down much of my knowledge here and later try to provide some easy way to connect things. Some guys are using some mindmap tools, but it seems not very fluent yet.

I also plan so finally develop my personal assistant based on it \([more about my plans](plans.md)\).
