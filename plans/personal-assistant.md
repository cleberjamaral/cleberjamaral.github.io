# personal assistant

My personal assistant is an agent to help me on real useful things. I really would like to have some tool that I can trust and delegate some tasks. Although many gadgets sounds to promote such things, I did not find any tool that make us less anxious and less stressed, providing ways to make me feel happier. To be short, this kind of agent already exists, it is called "friend", or "wife", or "mon", and other designations. But I still think that it is possible to have an artificial agent to provide some of important things that those ones I quote can do.
