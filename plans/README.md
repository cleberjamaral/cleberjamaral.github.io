# plans

I use [github projects](https://github.com/users/cleberjamaral/projects/) to manage my private dashboard with my current activities. But I have lots and lots of things that I would like to do, "just" need time do spend with them. I not gonna define a schedule for those things. I gonna just let them happen naturally.

## Things I would like to do

* I plan so finally develop my personal [assistant](personal-assistant.md).
* It looks old-fashioned but I still think I have to writing my experience with JAX-RS. This [article](https://javapapers.com/java/restful-web-services-with-java-jax-rs-using-jersey/) shows some very basic steps which is good to follow.
* Learn about quantum computing: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=JRIPV0dPAd4).
* Learn React: [chat](https://medium.com/@jasofalcon/simple-chat-react-java-6923b54d65a0), [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLDsxPGctY).
* Develop a simulation engine for JaCaMo. I can have some inspiration on [manim project](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) which can do simulations like this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs).
* Study [javassist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javassist) and improve the way to deal with running instances in [jacamo-web](https://github.com/jacamo-lang/jacamo-web) project.
* "Consulting Board": A MAS developing different agents to perform AI algorithms in specialised research fields. In an organisational dimension a coordination based in norms, trust and reputation may gather all opinions of these experts to suggest a decision. I have a first approach in this direction at the project called [financial agents](https://github.com/cleberjamaral/financialAgents/) which is \(usually\) running on this server. Right now, I am trying to put it in a [container managed by kubernetes](https://gist.github.com/cleberjamaral/2bbf21eb1bddfec8b4c6c01111eba102) as a workaround for some downtime I am experiencing.
* [Disaster-robotics-proalertas](https://disaster-robotics-proalertas.github.io/) which aims to build an integrated system to control a team of heterogeneous robots and alert systems.
* Work on a standard representation of BDI agents to support mobility across multiple platforms and frameworks.
* [Ferramenta de testes de códigos C para uso didático](https://wiki.sj.ifsc.edu.br/wiki/index.php/Ferramenta_de_testes_de_c%C3%B3digos_C_para_uso_did%C3%A1tico) is a tool for automatic test C codes to help students to get a prompt feedback and develop better codes. It uses gcc compiler and [frama-c](https://frama-c.com/) framework. Keywords: Programming, C language, Quality Assurance. Some insights in [Formal verification](https://www.quantamagazine.org/20160920-formal-verification-creates-hacker-proof-code/) A student code some related functions in [TestadorC](https://github.com/GuilhermeFFe/TestadorC).
* Enhance [Melissa](https://github.com/cleberjamaral/melissa) project, which is a MAS implementation in JaCaMo of a hive with GUI. With extra research it can be improved to perform more precisely like a natural hive. Later it may produce data to better understand the crucial conditions that influence in honey production.
* [Agents on chip](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5dc9f52b9987440001a9edee), a BDI microprocessor architecture for agents.
* I would like to paint. There are no excuses to do not start it. Just watching [this guy](https://youtu.be/mT0RNrTDHkI) is a great therapy against anxiety.
