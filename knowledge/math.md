# math

I plan to try some tools that have good support to symbolic mathematics. I think MathCAD is a good commercial option. In the free and open world I am thinking to study [SAGE](http://www.sagemath.org/) and [SMath](https://en.smath.com/view/SMathStudio/summary).

I often use [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/) and [wolframalpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com) which are tools that help me to create symbolic equations with graphical visualization.

I have lots of info I would like to retrieve and put here including statistics studies I have done.
