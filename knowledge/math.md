# math

I plan to try some tools that have good support to symbolic mathematics. I think MathCAD is a good commercial option. In the free and open world I am thinking to study [SAGE](http://www.sagemath.org/) and [SMath](https://en.smath.com/view/SMathStudio/summary).

I often use [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/) and [wolframalpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com) which are tools that help me to create symbolic equations with graphical visualization.

I have lots of info I would like to retrieve and put here including statistics studies I have done.

[video](https://youtu.be/kqSzLo9fenk) about bayes theorem, markov hidden chain and viterbi algorithm.

I am following coronavirus numbers with special interest on statistic techniques that are being used in [simulating an epidemic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs), [worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), [covid-19 dashboards](https://covid19dashboards.com/), [brazilian health ministry](https://covid.saude.gov.br/) and [new zealand health ministry](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-cases) statistics.
