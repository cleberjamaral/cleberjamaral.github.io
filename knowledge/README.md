### Do I really know it?

I try to register what I am studying as an exercise on summarizing information and trying to stablish knowledge. I also like [Feynman technique](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-feynman-technique-the-best-way-to-learn-anything) to teach to a child, review, organize and simplify, and transmit. However, I confess, in many situations when I am researching for something I don't put too much effort on the establishing part, I usually go more shallow just to quickly solve something what is not good.

### Other sources for knowledge

My private library is mostly stored in [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/library/) which has articles and books in PDF.

I use [Google Books](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.books) for the ones I have bought in Google Play Store or for the uploaded ones. [Kindle reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle&hl=en) for android is used for the ones I bought on Amazon. I also have a few books in PDF in my [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com).

I also have access to some libraries:

* [IFSC virtual library](http://biblioteca.ifsc.edu.br/)
* [UFSC virtual library](http://portal.bu.ufsc.br/)
* [Pearson virtual library](https://plataforma.bvirtual.com.br/)
