# knowledge

My private library is mostly stored in [mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/library/) which has articles and books in PDF.

I use [google books](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.books) for the ones I have bought in google play store or for the uploaded ones. [Kindle reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle&hl=en) for android is used for the ones I bought in amazon. I also have a few books in PDF in my [google drive](http://drive.google.com).
