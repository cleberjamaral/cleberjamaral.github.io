# knowledge

My private library is mostly stored in [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/library/) which has articles and books in PDF.

I use [Google Books](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.books) for the ones I have bought in Google Play Store or for the uploaded ones. [Kindle reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle&hl=en) for android is used for the ones I bought on Amazon. I also have a few books in PDF in my [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com).

I also have access to some libraries:

* [IFSC's Library](http://biblioteca.ifsc.edu.br/)
* [UFSC's Library](http://portal.bu.ufsc.br/)
* [Biblioteca Virtual da Pearson](https://plataforma.bvirtual.com.br/)
* [Biblioteca Digital Cengage](https://cengagebrasil.vstbridge.com/)
