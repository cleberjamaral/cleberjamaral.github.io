# writing

I am really terrible when writing specially when I compare myself to other authors. It is not easy to me to use nice words in a fluent and not boring writing. On the search for improving so, I am trying to keep active on reading and starting to take more notes when reading. Hopefully, some reads and notes can help me to write better.

Among my notes I use to consult a [signpost of linking words and phrases](https://gist.github.com/cleberjamaral/d7148453acc2cb7b500d8438822b7a87) that helps to make textual links and a [signpost of nice words and phrases](https://gist.github.com/cleberjamaral/b2c05a8b651d047642114ab38afd173c) which is a notebook for nice expressions I have collected.
