# expressions

I often consult a [signpost of linking words and phrases](https://gist.github.com/cleberjamaral/d7148453acc2cb7b500d8438822b7a87) and [signpost of correlative conjunctions](https://gist.github.com/cleberjamaral/cac090a3c28b7844a75768d1ea8926bf) that helps to make textual links and a [signpost of nice words and phrases](nice-signposts.md) which is a notebook for nice expressions I have collected. University o Manchester has a [phrasebank](http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/) which is actually much better.

### My favourite resources:

* [power thesaurus synonyms dictionary](https://www.powerthesaurus.org/) allows searching for expressions, it brings close expressions \(potentially synonyms\) that can infer the meaning.
* [linguee human translations database](https://www.linguee.com/) which gather lots of translations from English to other languages \(including Portuguese, French and German\). Some translations are verified which make them safer to base on. A correlated tool, which is good to check how journalists commonly use some expressions is [ludwig.guru](https://ludwig.guru/).
* [google translator](https://translate.google.com.br/) is a powerful tool that I often get meaning of something I did not understand and usually put on it texts I have written to check if it has consistency in another language.
* as dictionary I usually opt for [merriam-webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) which is easy and free. I also like [wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/).
* I also use [grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) and [language tool](https://www.languagetool.org/), which are useful to check for errors and get helpful tips in the way of improving the text.
