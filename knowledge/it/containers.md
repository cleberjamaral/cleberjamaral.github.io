### Containers orchestration

Kubernetes is a great and very accessible tool. Documentation is great. A good first step is starting from [kubernetes bootcamp](https://kubernetesbootcamp.github.io/), a practical course for beginners. I have some personal notes on [how to make kubernetes works](https://gist.github.com/cleberjamaral/2bbf21eb1bddfec8b4c6c01111eba102).
