# financial

Usually, I follow assets using a private spreadsheet which is based on [dlombello spreadsheets](https://sites.google.com/view/dlombelloplanilhas/planilhas/controle-de-investimentos). My radar is mostly based on [suno research](information-sources.md)'s recommendations.

I always pay attention to saving money and I am investing since my first salaries. About 40% of my wallet is based on stocks, 25% in bonds and other conservative assets, 20% in funds managed by professionals and 15% in Brazilian REITs.
