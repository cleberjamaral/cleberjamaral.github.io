# machine learning

Here I am writing a collection of notes I have about data science and machine learning. I am starting with the approach used by [Guilherme Silveira](https://github.com/guilhermesilveira) in a [short course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccZ2pyr3YDw) \(in Portuguese\).

### Understanding data science

A good way to understand is by a simple example. Let us say we are observing some animals in a farm that has pigs and dogs. In this observation let us say we can easily check three features of any animal, if it has long fur, has short leg and says woof. We will use zeros and ones to describe each feature.
