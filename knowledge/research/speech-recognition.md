# speech recognition

Speech recognition which studies methods to write down human speech. There are many tools that already do this job, some commercial ones and other open and free. Some commercial are [Google Cloud Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/speech/), [Microsoft Bing Voice Recognition](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/speech-api), [Houndify API](https://houndify.com/) and [IBM Speech to Text](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/speech-to-text.html). They also have some trial plans. As free options we have [Snowboy Hotword Detection](https://snowboy.kitt.ai/) which is free for non-commercial use and [CMU Sphinx](http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/) which is free for any purpose, both work off-line.

For development in python, the library [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) has support for several speech recognition tools.
