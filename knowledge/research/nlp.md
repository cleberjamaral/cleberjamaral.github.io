# nlp

Natural Language Processing \(NPL\) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) that studies how to extract meaning from human natural language. It differs from [speech recognition](speech-recognition.md) which studies methods to write down human speech. In this sense, NPL may be a second process, after speech recognition process.

Some tools are [Apache OpenNPL](http://opennlp.apache.org/) and [Wit.ai](https://wit.ai/) are free.

For development in python, the library [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) has support for some tools.
