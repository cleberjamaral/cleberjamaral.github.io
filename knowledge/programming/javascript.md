# javascript

This is a very useful article showing [how to replace jquery code by plain javascript](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) equivalents.

I want to try [jslint](http://www.jslint.com) to improve my javascript coding.

Something I have to improve in JS is the way to debug code. Maybe this [article](https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-debugging/) can be useful.
