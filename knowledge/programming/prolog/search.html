<p>Recursion is the primary control mechanism for Prolog programming,
and the list structure is the primary data structure used for representing
complex data.

<h3>Recursion Example</h3>

<blockquote>
<pre>
ancestor_of(Ancest,Descend) :-  parent_of(Ancest,Descend).  /* base case */
ancestor_of(Ancest,Descend) :-  parent_of(Z,Descend),      /* recursive case */
                                ancestor_of(Ancest,Z).
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><b>In-class Exercise: </b>Trace <tt>ancestor_of(X,d)</tt> 
using the following facts.

<blockquote>
<pre>
parent_of(a,b).
parent_of(b,c).
parent_of(c,d).
parent_of(d,e).
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><b>In-class Exercise: </b>Define a recursive <tt>descendant_of(X,Y)</tt>.


<h3>Prolog List Notation</h3>

In Prolog list elements are enclosed by brackets  and separated by commas.

<pre>
  [1,2,3,4]
  [[mary,joe],[bob,carol,ted,alice]]
  []
</pre>

<p>Another way to represent a list is to use the <b>head/tail
notation</b> <tt>[H|T]</tt>. Here the head of the list, H, is
separated from the tail of the list, T, by a vertical bar. The tail of
a list is the original list with its first element removed. The tail
of a list is always a list, even if it's the empty list.

<p>In Prolog, the H|T notation is used together with unification to
combine and break up lists. For example, suppose we have the following
list:

<pre>
  [bob,carol,ted,alice]
</pre>

Here's the various matches we would obtain using H|T:

<pre>
  [X|Y]        matches with X=bob Y=[carol,ted,alice]
  [X,Y|Z]      matches with X=bob, Y=carol, Z=[ted,alice]
  [X,Y,Z|W]    matches with X=bob, Y=carol, Z=ted W=[alice]
  [X,Y,Z,W|V]  matches with X=bob, Y=carol, Z=ted,  W=alice and V=[]
  [X,Y,Z,Y]    won't match because Y=carol and carol != alice
  [X,Y,Z,W,V|U] won't match because the list does not contain 5 elements
</pre>

<p>We can also build lists using unification and H|T notation. Suppose
L unifies with [X|Y] and X=bob and Y=[carol,ted,alice]. Then
L=[bob,carol,ted,alice].

<h3>Recursive List Examples</h3>

<p>In some Prolog environments the <tt>member</tt> predicate is not a
built-in predicate and must be defined within your program. It takes
the form <tt>member(Element,List)</tt> and evaluates to true if and
only if Element is a member of List.  The underscore (_) can be used
as a <b>anonymous</b> or <b>don't care</b> variable, meaning we don't
care what value it has. It's there solely for pattern-matching (unification)
purposes.

<blockquote>
<pre>
member(X,[X|_]).          /* 1. Base case:      X is a member of the list headed by X */
member(X,[Y|L]) :-        /* 2.  Recursive case: X is a member of the list headed by Y */
   member(X,L).           /*                     if X is a member of that list's tail (L) */
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's a trace of the member() predicate on the query: member(c,[a,b,c]).

<blockquote>
<pre>
member(c,[a,b,c]).
    call 1 (base case). fails, since c != a.
    call 2 (recursive case). X=c, Y=a, L=[b,c], member(c,[b,c]) ?
      call 1 (base). fails, since c != b.
      call 2 (recursive). X=c, Y=b, L=[c], member(c,[c]) ?
         call 1. Success, c = c.
      Yes to call 2. (backing out of recursion)
    Yes to call 2.   (backing out of recursion)
Yes.                 (original query succeeds)
</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>Here's a trace of the member() predicate on the query: member(c,[a,b]).

<blockquote>
<pre>
member(c,[a,b]).
    call 1 (base case). fails, since c != a.
    call 2 (recursive case). X=c, Y=a, L=[b], member(c,[b]) ?
      call 1 (base). fails, since c != b.
      call 2 (recursive). X=c, Y=b, L=[], member(c,[]) ?
         call 1. fails, since [] does not match [X|_].
         call 2. fails, since [] does not match [Y|L].
      No to call 2. (backing out of recursion)
    No to call 2.   (backing out of recursion)
No.                 (original query succeeds)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The following predicate writes each element of a list using Prolog's
built-in <tt>write()</tt> predicate and built-in <tt>nl</tt> (newline)
predicate:

<blockquote>
<pre>
writelist([]).                                 /* Base case: An empty list */
writelist([H|T]) :- write(H),nl,writelist(T).  /* Recursive case: */
</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>The following predicate writes a list in reverse order:
<blockquote>

<pre>
reverse_writelist([]).                                         /* Base case: An empty list */
reverse_writelist([H|T]) :- reverse_writelist(T),write(H),nl.  /* Recursive case: */
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Knight's Tour</H3>

Suppose we represent the squares of a 3 x 3 chess board with the
following notation:

<pre>
   1  2  3
   4  5  6
   7  8  9
</pre>

Then the following list of predicates describe all of the legal moves that
a knight can make on such a chess board:

<pre>
  move(1,6).   move(3,4).    move(6,7).   move(8,3).
  move(1,8).   move(3,8).    move(6,1).   move(8,1).
  move(2,7).   move(4,3).    move(7,6).   move(9,4).
  move(2,9).   move(4,9).    move(7,2).   move(9,2).
</pre>

Suppose you wanted to determine whether a path exists from one
square to another using just the legal knight moves. Here's a
recursive predicate for path:

<pre>
   path(Z,Z).
   path(X,Y) :- move(X,W),not(been(W)),assert(been(W)),path(W,Y).
</pre>

This version of <tt>path()</tt> uses the <tt>assert()</tt> predicate
to maintain a list of visited states. This will prevent looping.

<p>An alternative design would be to use a list to represent the
visited states, and just carry the list along as a third parameter:

<pre>
   path(Z,Z,L).
   path(X,Y,L) :- move(X,Z),not(member(Z,L)),path(Z,Y,[Z|L]).
</pre>

The third parameter maintains a list of visited states. Note how
the  state Z is added to the list in the recursive call. 

<h3>Exercise</h3>

Trace the following query: path(1,3,[1]).

<h3>The Cut Operator</h3>

The <b>cut</b> operator, which is represented by the exclamation point, !, is
used to cut off backtracking. The syntax for cut is that of a goal with
no arguments. It has two important side-effects:

<ul>
<li>The cut operator always succeeds.
<P><li>If it is "failed back to", during backtracking, it causes the
    entire goal to fail.
</ul>

One of the best uses of the cut operator is in the definition of 
Prolog's <tt>not()</tt> predicate, which recall represents <b>negation
as failure</b>.

<pre>
   not(P) :- call(P),!,fail.     /* Call P. If it succeeds, fail.          */
   not(P).                       /* If Call P fails, then not(P) succeeds. */
