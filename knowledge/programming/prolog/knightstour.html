<h3>Introduction</h3>

In the game of chess, a knight can move either two squares horizontally and one
vertically or two vertically followed by one square horizontally, as
long as it remains on the board.  There are thus eight possible
moves that the knight can make:

<pre>
   2 left, 1 down
   2 left, 1 up
   2 right, 1 down
   2 right, 1 up
   2 up, 1 left
   2 up, 1 right
   2 down, 1 left
   2 down, 1 right
</pre>

<p>In <a href="http://www.delphiforfun.org/programs/knights_tour.htm">knight's
tour problem</a> the goal is to find a series of legal moves in which
the knight lands on each square of the chessboard exactly once.

<p>We will look at a <b>simplified verions</b> in which the goal is to
find a series of legal moves that takes the knight from one square to
another on a 3 x 3 chessboard.

<h3>The Simplified Knight's Tour</h3>

Suppose we represent the squares of a 3 x 3 chess board with the
following notation:

<pre>
   1  2  3
   4  5  6
   7  8  9
</pre>

Then the following list of predicates describe all of the legal moves that
a knight can make on such a chess board:

<pre>
  move(1,6).   move(3,4).    move(6,7).   move(8,3).
  move(1,8).   move(3,8).    move(6,1).   move(8,1).
  move(2,7).   move(4,3).    move(7,6).   move(9,4).
  move(2,9).   move(4,9).    move(7,2).   move(9,2).
</pre>

Suppose you wanted to determine whether a path exists from one
square to another using just the legal knight moves. Here's a
recursive predicate for path:

<pre>
   path(Z,Z).
   path(X,Y) :- move(X,W),not(visited(W)),asserta(visited(W)),path(W,Y).
</pre>

This version of <tt>path()</tt> uses the <tt>asserta()</tt> predicate
to maintain a list of visited states. This will prevent looping.
Here's a <a href="knights16v1.pl.txt">PROLOG implementation</a> of this
design.

<h3>Exercise</h3>

1. What facts will get asserted during the query <b>path(1,2)</b>?


<p>An alternative design would be to use a list to represent the
visited states, and just carry the list along as a third parameter:

<pre>
   path(Z,Z,L).
   path(X,Y,L) :- move(X,Z),not(member(Z,L)),path(Z,Y,[Z|L]).
</pre>

The third parameter maintains a list of visited states. Note how
the  state Z is added to the list in the recursive call. 
Here's a <a href="knights16v2.pl.txt">PROLOG implementation</a> of this
design.

<h3>Exercise</h3>

1. Trace the following query: <b>path(1,3,[1])</b>.

<h3>Generalizing the Representation for 8 x 8 Chessboard</h3>

<p>Another way to code the rules that would work better for an 8 x 8
board. We illustrate this approach using a 4 x 4 board but the same
principles and relations will apply for an N x N board.  Suppose the
board is numbered starting from 0:

<pre>
0  1  2  3       (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3)
4  5  6  7       (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)
8  9  10 11      (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3)
12 13 14 15      (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3)
</pre>

There 8 types of knight moves:

<pre>
right 1 down 2   left 1 down 2
right 2 down 1   left 2 down 1
right 1 up 2     left 1 up 2
right 2 up 1     left 2 up 1
</pre>

<p>Here's a definition for right 1 down 2. If the present location is X,
then find the row and column numbers for Y. For any X, ColX is X mod 4
and RowX is X div 4. E.g., if X = 0, then (RowX,ColX) = (0,0); if X = 6, 
then (RowX,ColX) = (1,2); if X = 15, the (RowX,ColX) = (3,3). After
you compute (RowX,ColX), then moving right 1 down 2 gives
(RowX+2,ColX+1). But then these numbers have to be converted back to
square number using the formula: Y = Row * 4 + Col. Here's
what it looks like in PROLOG.

<pre>
move(X,Y) :- 
	ColX is X mod 4,      % remainder of X/4
        RowX is X // 4,       % divisor of X/4
        Col is ColX + 1,      % right 1
        Col < 4,           
        Row is RowX + 2,      % down 2
	Row < 4,
        Y is Row * 4 + Col,
        Y >= 0.
</pre>


<h3>Analysis of the Knight's Tour</h3>

<p><b>Could the above exhaustive approach be extended to the full Knight's Tour?</b>

<p>The goal of the Knight's Tour is to construct a path from
an arbitrary position on the chess board such that it visits
each square on the board exactly once. Can this problem be
solved through exhaustive search?

<p>What's the (average) <b>branching factor, B</b> for the Knight's Tour?

<p>What's the <b>path length, L</b> for a successful solution
of the Knight's Tour?

<p>Approximately how many states, T, would be involved in the
exhaustive search of the Knight's Tour? (approximately B<sup>L</sup>)

<h3>Warnsdorf's Heuristic</h3> 

Fortunately there is a well know heuristic for the Knight's Tour,
which was discovered by H.C. von Warnsdorf in 1823. (See <a href="http://www.delphiforfun.org/programs/knights_tour.htm">the Delphi website</a> for a brief discussion of the Knight's Tour and
other puzzles.)

<p>The heuristic tells us to select as our next move the one that has the fewest
choices for moving on from there.
