# mas

Unfortunately, there is a big gap, maybe a chasm, between MAS academic and industry research and development. I often see the academy struggling to find meaning for the studies and the industry struggling to create solutions that were already well discussed in the academy and sometimes solved in the way it is needed. Therefore, I am always trying to associate the real-life technologies with the theories I am reading at academy. Here I am pointing out some applications that are MAS but are not often seen like agent systems.

### Modern industrial warehouses

* [Cainiao](https://global.cainiao.com/) a tech company that develops logistic solutions has equipped Alibaba [warehouse with over 700 robots](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/30/alibaba-cainiao-chinas-biggest-robot-warehouse-for-singles-day.html). As shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvEzDNxj7hA), autonomous vehicles \(AVG\) move shelves around the warehouse taking product stacks to employees that can easily pick what they need releasing the robot to take the shelve back. AVG communicate with each other to avoid collision and go automatically to recharging cradles.
