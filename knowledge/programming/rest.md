# REST

### Open APIs 

* How many astronauts are in space right now? What are the names of those astronauts? on [Astros](http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json) 

### Good references

* This article of Gregor Roth written in 2009 shows [RESTful HTTP in practice](https://www.infoq.com/articles/designing-restful-http-apps-roth/), a good reference to have an overview of REST concepts.
