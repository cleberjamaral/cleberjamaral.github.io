# programming

This section is about programming. Most of subsections are detailing programming languages that I have used.

### Common concepts

[P vs NP problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX40hbAHx3s): P problems are the ones that we say can be solved "fast" or in Polynomial Time. NP is about harder problems, it stands for Non-deterministic Polynomial Time a class of problems that the worst case can be solved in Polynomial Time by Non-deterministic Turing machines. Still, there are NP-Hard/NP-Complete problems which there is no known way to solve in polynomial time. Although it is hard to find solutions, the solutions of all these problems are testable in polynomial time. Oppositely, problems in the class of EXPonential Time cannot be quickly tested.
