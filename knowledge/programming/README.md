# programming

This section is about programming. Most of the subsections are detailing programming languages that I have used.

### Navigating

* [C/C++](c-c++.md) programming languages information
* [eclipse](eclipse.md) IDE shortcuts and tips
* [java](java/) programming language
* [javascript](javascript.md) programming language
* [prolog](prolog.md) and prolog-like laguages
* [REST](rest.md) integration architecture
* [version control](git/) systems

### Learning programming

* For the first steps and children it is great to try [code.org](https://code.org/) and [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).
* [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/start) is a nice tool for learning many languages such as Java, Javascript, C and others. 

### Common concepts

[P vs NP problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX40hbAHx3s): P problems are the ones that we say can be solved "fast" or in Polynomial Time. NP is about harder problems, it stands for Non-deterministic Polynomial Time a class of problems that the worst case can be solved in Polynomial Time by Non-deterministic Turing machines. Still, there are NP-Hard/NP-Complete problems which there is no known way to solve in polynomial time. Although it is hard to find solutions, the solutions of all these problems are testable in polynomial time. Oppositely, solutions of problems in the class of EXPonential Time cannot be quickly tested. [This MIT course](https://youtu.be/eHZifpgyH_4) can also help.
